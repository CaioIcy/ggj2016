# The Summonerish

A **Global Game Jam 2016** game: http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/summonerish

## About

In a dark but comic setting, you must gather followers to your wannabe evil cult and summon one of the creatures of the underworld to impress them. Fail the summoning ritual and call forth the wrong creature!  
In a short and sweet, fast paced gameplay, the cult leader (you!) must correctly follow the summoning ritual instructions as a sequence of inputs. Each turn there is a random sequence to perform. Depending on your turn performance, you gain or lose followers. If you reach zero followers, you definitely did something wrong and will summon what you don't want! You can keep track of all the creatures you've already summoned.
